        Bitcoin block 813,958, mined on Oct. 26, 2023 by AntPool, a cluster of miners known as a
        mining pool, had a nonce of 105,983,939.
        That day, AntPool had a bitcoin hashrate of 123 exa-hashes per second (or 123 quintillion
        hashes) and the entire Bitcoin network hashed at 428.22 exa-hashes per second
        (or 428.22 quintillion hashes). That means the AntPool mining pool alone generated
        quadrillions of numbers to find the correct nonce and winning hash, out of an exponentially
        many more number of trials for all mining pools combined
